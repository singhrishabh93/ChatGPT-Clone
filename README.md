# ChatGPT Clone (Rishabh's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer)

This project aims to create a ChatGPT clone using HTML, Flask, and the OpenAI API. The ChatGPT clone will provide an interactive chat interface where users can have conversations with an AI-powered language model.

## Features

- Real-time interactive chat interface
- AI-powered responses generated by OpenAI API
- HTML and Flask for the front-end and back-end implementation
- Easy integration with the OpenAI API

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following:

- Python 3.x installed
- OpenAI API access (you will need an OpenAI API key)
- Flask (Python web framework)
- HTML and CSS knowledge

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


4. Install the required Python dependencies:


5. Set up your OpenAI API key:
- Create an account on the OpenAI website and obtain an API key.
- Export your API key as an environment variable:

  ```
  export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
  ```

6. Start the Flask development server:


7. Access the application in your browser by visiting [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Configuration

If needed, you can modify the following configuration options in the `config.py` file:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Set your OpenAI API key here.
- `MODEL_NAME`: Specify the name of the OpenAI language model to use (e.g., "gpt-3.5-turbo").
- `MAX_TOKENS`: Set the maximum number of tokens allowed for each conversation turn.

Note: It is recommended to store sensitive information such as API keys in a secure manner when deploying the application.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Enter your message in the chat interface and press "Enter" or click the send button.
3. The AI-powered language model will process your message and generate a response.
4. The response will be displayed in the chat interface.
5. Continue the conversation by entering more messages.

## Limitations

- The accuracy and quality of the responses generated by the language model depend on the training data and the chosen model. It may not always provide correct or sensible answers.
- The OpenAI API has rate limits and pricing considerations. Refer to the OpenAI documentation for more information.
